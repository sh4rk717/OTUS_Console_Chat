- **Scalable Design**: Implements repositories and services for clean separation of concerns and future extensibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C# (100%)
- **Core Principles**:
  - Dependency Injection
  - SOLID Design Principles
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: For lightweight prototyping and testing.
- **Console Bot Framework**: Mimics bot-client interaction for task management.
